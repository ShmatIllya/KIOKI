Out of the skies, and from over the waters
they come to bring slaughter-to all mankind.
Soldiers of fortune, administer torture
they rip out your heart-and leave you to die.
Plunder and pillage, and rape of the villages,
towns, and the cities-burnt to the ground.
Banish the nation, till their occupation
means nothing is left of the old world order...

Hawk will rise and conquer,
Tudor knights downtrodden,
with the battle won.
 
Can this be a new beginning?
Bring an end to all the killing?
 
Tudor indecision,
rife with deep derision,
so the civil war will,
cause confusion as the,
Hawk will rise and conquer,
Tudor knights downtrodden,
with the battle won.
 
Can this be a new beginning?
Bring an end to all the killing?
Century of war has ended,
can the battle scars be mended? (x3)
